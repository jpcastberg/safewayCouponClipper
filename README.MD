# Safeway Coupon Clipper
When I found out that I was going to have to manually clip my Safeway coupons, I said NO WAY JOSE, and wrote this program.

Safeway Coupon Clipper logs on to your Safeway account and clips all of your coupons for you. If you have the launchd scheduler available on your machine, Safeway Coupon Clipper will run every morning. If your machine is asleep when the Coupon Clipper is scheduled to run, the Coupon Clipper will run as soon as your machine wakes up!

## How to use
This program requires Nodejs and npm to use.

## Uninstalling
